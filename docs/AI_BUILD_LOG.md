# AI Build Log — How AI Built This Toolkit

> A document of AI tooling used throughout BNB Chain AI Toolkit development.

There's something deeply recursive about this project: **I used AI to build an AI toolkit.** The MCP servers that give AI models blockchain access were themselves built with AI assistance. The 72+ agents that help users interact with DeFi were defined with AI help. The documentation you're reading right now was drafted by AI. This isn't just using AI as a productivity tool — it's AI building its own infrastructure.

## AI Tools Used

Every major AI coding assistant was used during development. The proof is baked into the repo itself — dedicated instruction files for each tool, sitting at the repository root:

| AI Tool | Role | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code (Anthropic)** | Primary development assistant | [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — dedicated instruction file with project structure, commands, and terminal management rules |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Code completion & in-editor assistance | [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](../.github/copilot-instructions.md) — custom instructions with project-specific context |
| **Google Gemini** | Alternative development assistant | [`GEMINI.md`](../GEMINI.md) — dedicated instruction file at repo root |
| **Cursor** | AI-powered IDE | Used for rapid prototyping and code generation across the monorepo |
| **Claude Desktop + MCP** | Dogfooding — testing our own MCP servers | The toolkit's MCP servers were tested by connecting them to Claude Desktop during development |

These aren't boilerplate files. Each one contains project-specific instructions — directory layouts, build commands, terminal management rules for Codespaces — that only make sense if I was actively using these tools daily. The [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) file serves as a shared development guideline across all AI assistants.

## How AI Was Used — By Component

### 1. AI Agent Definitions (72+ agents)

The core of this project is 72+ AI agent definitions split across [`agents/bnb-chain-agents/`](../agents/bnb-chain-agents/) (30 BNB Chain-specific agents) and [`agents/defi-agents/`](../agents/defi-agents/) (42 general DeFi agents).

- I used AI to generate the initial `systemRole` prompts for every agent — describing each agent's persona, expertise boundaries, and behavioral guidelines
- Each agent's opening questions and conversation flows were AI-drafted, then I curated them to ensure they matched real user needs (e.g., the PancakeSwap expert knows about v3 concentrated liquidity, not just generic DEX talk)
- Agent metadata — tags, categories, descriptions — were AI-generated from the system prompts for consistency
- All 30+ language translations in [`locales/`](../locales/) (30 agent directories, each with multiple language files) were AI-generated. That's thousands of translated strings across languages like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and more
- Agent JSON schema validation was AI-designed to catch malformed definitions early

### 2. MCP Servers (6 servers, 900+ tools)

The [`mcp-servers/`](../mcp-servers/) directory contains six self-contained MCP servers — this was the most technically demanding part.

- **`bnbchain-mcp`** — 100+ tools for BNB Chain + EVM operations. I used AI to scaffold the TypeScript server structure following the MCP SDK patterns, then iteratively built out each tool
- **`binance-mcp`** — 478+ tools wrapping the Binance.com API. AI generated the tool definitions and parameter schemas from API documentation, which I then validated against real API responses
- **`binance-us-mcp`** — US-compliant variant. AI helped identify which endpoints differ between Binance.com and Binance.US
- **`universal-crypto-mcp`** — 60+ network support, 100+ tools. AI assisted with chain-specific configuration (RPC URLs, chain IDs, block explorers)
- **`agenti`** — Universal EVM + Solana MCP server. AI scaffolded the multi-chain abstraction layer
- **`ucai`** — Python ABI-to-MCP generator. AI generated the ABI parsing logic and dynamic tool creation code

Error handling patterns, input validation, and README documentation for each server were all AI-drafted and human-reviewed.

### 3. ERC-8004 Standard

The [`standards/erc-8004/`](../standards/erc-8004/) directory contains a novel on-chain agent discovery and trust protocol.

- The ERC-8004 specification itself was co-authored with AI — I described the concept (on-chain agent registration with capability discovery), and AI helped formalize it into EIP-style specification language
- Solidity contract code was AI-generated and then I audited it for security (reentrancy, access control, gas optimization)
- CREATE2 deployment scripts were AI-assisted for deterministic cross-chain addresses
- The 24-chain deployment configuration used AI to gather chain-specific parameters (gas prices, block confirmers, RPC endpoints)
- The deterministic `0x8004` vanity prefix address mining was AI-optimized

### 4. Documentation (17 guides)

The [`docs/`](../docs/) directory contains 17 files ranging from beginner guides to deep technical references.

- [`what-is-this.md`](what-is-this.md) — The beginner-friendly explainer was specifically written for non-technical audiences. I prompted AI to "explain this like the reader has never heard of blockchain or AI agents" and iterated from there
- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — System architecture with Mermaid diagrams. The diagrams were AI-generated from my description of component relationships
- [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md), [`faq.md`](faq.md), [`troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md) — AI-drafted based on real issues I encountered during development
- [`awesome.md`](awesome.md) — Curated resource list, AI-helped with categorization and descriptions
- The README's ASCII art banner was AI-generated (yes, really — it took several iterations to get the spacing right)
- Hackathon submission documents were AI-drafted from structured prompts

### 5. Frontend (React + Vite)

The web interface for browsing agents was built with AI assistance:

- React components for the agent browser (search, filter, detail view) were AI-scaffolded
- Tailwind CSS styling was AI-assisted — I described the desired look and AI generated the utility classes
- Responsive design breakpoints and mobile layout were AI-suggested
- Accessibility features aligned with W3AG were AI-implemented
- Vite configuration and build optimization were AI-helped

### 6. Build Pipeline & Tooling

The [`scripts/`](../scripts/) directory contains the build pipeline that transforms source agent JSONs into the published index.

- Formatters, validators, parsers, and builders in `scripts/` were AI-generated
- JSON Schema validation for agent definitions was AI-designed to catch malformed agents early
- The i18n translation pipeline (`.i18nrc.js`, validation scripts) was AI-built
- CI/CD configuration, Docker setup (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`), and deployment scripts were AI-assisted
- ESLint configuration, TypeScript configs, and Vite/Vitest setup were AI-generated

## AI Development Workflow

My workflow followed a consistent pattern throughout the project:

1. **Prompt** — I describe what needs to be built in natural language. For example: "Create an MCP tool that fetches BNB staking validators with their commission rates and APY"
2. **Generate** — AI generates the initial implementation — code, types, error handling, documentation
3. **Review** — I review for correctness (does it call the right API?), security (is it leaking keys?), and quality (is the code maintainable?)
4. **Iterate** — Back-and-forth refinement. "Add pagination support." "Handle the case where the RPC is down." "Make the error messages more helpful."
5. **Test** — AI helps write tests and think through edge cases I might miss
6. **Document** — AI generates documentation from the final code, ensuring docs stay in sync with implementation

This cycle ran hundreds of times across every component. The instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) evolved alongside the project. As the repo structure changed — especially during the v2.0.0 monorepo consolidation that merged 14 repositories — I updated these files so AI assistants always had current context.

## Quantitative AI Usage

Honest estimates of AI contribution across the project:

| Category | AI Contribution | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial code drafts | ~80% | AI wrote first drafts; I reviewed, edited, and finalized |
| Documentation | ~90% | AI-drafted, human-edited for accuracy and tone |
| Agent system prompts | ~70% | AI-generated base prompts, heavily curated for domain accuracy |
| Translations (30+ languages) | 100% | Entirely AI-generated across 30 locale directories |
| Solidity contracts | ~60% | AI-generated, human-audited for security |
| Deployment scripts | ~75% | AI-assisted with chain-specific configs |
| Test code | ~70% | AI suggested test scenarios; I validated coverage |
| Architecture decisions | ~30% | I made the key decisions; AI helped evaluate trade-offs |

All 3 instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) prove continuous AI tool usage across the full development lifecycle. The v2.0.0 monorepo consolidation (merging 14 repos into one) was the most AI-intensive phase — restructuring imports, updating paths, resolving conflicts across thousands of files. AI handled the mechanical work while I focused on architectural coherence.

## The Meta Layer

This deserves its own section because it is central to the project's identity.

I built **an AI toolkit** — a collection of agents, MCP servers, and tools designed to give AI models access to blockchain infrastructure. And I built it **with AI tools** — Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor.

The MCP servers that let Claude read BNB Chain data? Claude helped write them. The agent definitions that tell AI models how to be a "PancakeSwap Expert"? AI generated those system prompts. The ERC-8004 standard for on-chain agent discovery? Co-authored with AI. The documentation explaining how to use AI tools? Written by AI.

This isn't a contradiction — it's the point. The best way to build tools for AI is to use AI to build them. The AI assistants surfaced edge cases, suggested API patterns, and caught errors that a solo developer would have missed. The result is a toolkit that's more robust precisely because AI was involved at every layer.

The project is designed so that AI can contribute to its own ecosystem — agents can be defined by AI, servers can be extended by AI, and documentation can be maintained by AI. The human role is architecture, curation, review, and deployment.
