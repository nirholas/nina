# What Is This?

A complete explanation for anyone — no tech background assumed.

## The 30-Second Version

**BNB Chain AI Toolkit** is a free, open-source collection of tools that lets AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, and others) interact with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Think of it this way:

> Right now, if you ask Claude "What's the price of BNB?", it **guesses** based on old training data.
>
> With this toolkit, Claude can **actually look it up** — in real time, from the blockchain itself.

It goes much further than prices. The AI can check wallet balances, execute trades, analyze DeFi protocols, sweep leftover tokens, bridge assets between chains, and more.

## Why Does This Exist?

### The Problem (Before This Toolkit)

Imagine you want an AI to help you with crypto. Here's what that looks like today:

1. You open ChatGPT and ask "What's my wallet balance?"
2. The AI says "I can't access your wallet. Can you paste the data here?"
3. You go to a block explorer, copy the information, paste it back
4. The AI analyzes the static text you gave it
5. You need trading help? Open a different tool. Portfolio tracking? Another tool. News? Yet another.

Everything is **disconnected**. The AI is smart but blind — it can think about crypto but can't *see* or *touch* it.

### The Solution (With This Toolkit)

1. You open Claude and ask "What's my wallet balance?"
2. Claude calls the BNB Chain MCP server, which checks the blockchain directly
3. Claude says "Your wallet has 1.5 BNB ($930), 500 USDT, and 12 small tokens worth about $8 combined. Want me to sweep those dust tokens into USDC?"
4. You say yes, Claude executes the sweep
5. All within a single conversation — no switching tools, no copy-pasting

**The toolkit gives AI hands, not just a brain.**

## Real-World Analogies

If these concepts feel abstract, these comparisons might help:

| Concept | Real-World Analogy |
|---------|-------------------|
| **AI Agent** | A new hire with a specialized resume. They know their domain deeply (trading, staking, security audit), but they need tools to actually do the work. |
| **MCP Server** | The office equipment (phone, computer, CRM). It gives the new hire access to the outside world — without it, they can only talk. |
| **Blockchain** | A public accounting ledger in a glass building. Everyone can see every transaction, but only the account owners can make changes. |
| **Wallet** | A keyring. It holds the keys to your accounts. Your money lives on the blockchain, not "in" the wallet. |
| **Smart Contract** | A vending machine. You put the right input in (tokens), and it gives the right output (other tokens, a receipt, etc.) automatically — no human middleman. |
| **Dust** | The loose change in your couch cushions, across 8 different couches. |
| **Bridge** | A currency exchange booth at the airport, but between blockchains instead of countries. |

## What's Inside the Toolkit

The toolkit has six main parts. You can use any of them independently — you don't need all of them.

### 1. AI Agents (78)

**What they are:** Pre-built "personality profiles" for AI assistants. Each one is specialized for a specific crypto task.

**Real-world analogy:** Imagine hiring 78 different financial experts. One knows everything about PancakeSwap (a crypto exchange), another is a staking specialist, another tracks whale wallets, another audits smart contracts for security flaws.

You load an agent into Claude or ChatGPT, and it behaves like that expert.

**Example agents and what they do:**

| Agent | What It Does | When You'd Use It |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🥞 **PancakeSwap Trader** | Helps you trade tokens on PancakeSwap | You want to swap BNB for CAKE |
| 🏦 **Venus Protocol Expert** | Knows lending and borrowing inside out | You want to earn interest on your USDT |
| 📊 **Portfolio Analyst** | Tracks your crypto portfolio performance | You want to see how your holdings are doing |
| 🔍 **Security Auditor** | Checks if a token or contract is safe | Someone told you about a "great new token" |
| 🐋 **Whale Tracker** | Monitors big wallets for trading signals | You want to see what smart money is doing |
| 🌉 **Bridge Navigator** | Helps move tokens between blockchains | You want to send USDC from Ethereum to BSC |

**For the full list of all 78 agents:** [Agents Guide](agents.md)

### 2. MCP Servers (6)

**What they are:** Bridges between AI assistants and the outside world. MCP is a standard (created by Anthropic) that lets AI directly use external tools — like checking blockchain data or placing trades.

**Real-world analogy:** If AI agents are the experts, MCP servers are the phone lines that let them actually call the blockchain and get real-time data. Without MCP, the expert can only give theoretical advice based on old information.

| Server | What It Connects To | Example Use |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **BNB Chain MCP** | BSC, opBNB, Greenfield, 10+ EVM chains | Check balances, deploy contracts, execute swaps |
| **Binance MCP** | Binance.com exchange | Spot/futures trading, portfolio management |
| **Binance US MCP** | Binance.US (US-compliant) | Trading for US-based users |
| **Universal Crypto MCP** |  blockchain networks | Cross-chain DeFi, bridging |
| **Agenti** | EVM chains + Solana | Multi-chain operations, AI-to-AI payments |
| **UCAI** | Any smart contract, any where | Turn any contract's ABI into an AI tool |

**For setup instructions:** [MCP Servers Guide](mcp-servers.md)

### 3. Market Data

**What it is:** Real-time cryptocurrency prices, news, and market sentiment from hundreds of sources.

- **Crypto Market Data** — Live prices, market caps, TVL, historical data from CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and more
- **Crypto News** — Headlines from 200+ sources with sentiment analysis

**Example:** Ask Claude "Is it a good time to buy BNB?" — with market data connected, Claude can check the actual price, the Fear & Greed Index, recent news sentiment, and TVL trends before answering.

**For details:** [Market Data Guide](market-data.md)

### 4. DeFi Tools

**What it is:** Practical utilities for managing your crypto.

The main tool is the **Dust Sweeper** — it scans your wallet across 8 chains for tiny token balances (the loose change between couch cushions), finds which ones can actually be sold, batch-swaps them into a stablecoin like USDC, and can even bridge everything to one chain. It can recover hundreds of dollars that you didn't know you had.

**For details:** [DeFi Tools Guide](defi-tools.md)

### 5. Wallets

**What it is:** Create and manage cryptocurrency wallets, completely offline if needed.

- Generate new wallets with seed phrases
- Generate vanity addresses (addresses with custom prefixes)
- Sign messages and transactions without touching the internet
- Import and export keystore files

**For details:** [Wallets Guide](wallets.md)

### 6. Standards

**What they are:** Two open specifications this project created to make the crypto world better:

- **ERC-8004** — A blockchain protocol for AI agents to register themselves, build reputation, and discover each other. Think of it as "LinkedIn for AI agents" but on the blockchain, so nobody can fake their profile.
- **W3AG** — Web3 Accessibility Guidelines, the first standard for making crypto apps usable by people with disabilities (screen readers, keyboard navigation, etc.).

**For details:** [Standards Guide](standards.md)

## How Does It All Work Together?

Here's the complete flow when you ask Claude a crypto question with this toolkit installed:

```
 ┌──────────┐       ┌──────────────┐       ┌────────────┐       ┌────────────┐
 │   You    │──────▶│   Claude     │──────▶│ MCP Server │──────▶│ Blockchain │
 │          │       │ + AI Agent   │       │            │       │  (BSC)     │
 │ "What's  │       │              │       │ Calls the  │       │            │
 │  my BNB  │       │ Uses the     │       │ blockchain │       │ Returns    │
 │  balance?"│      │ wallet agent │       │ RPC node   │       │ 1.5 BNB    │
 └──────────┘       └──────────────┘       └────────────┘       └────────────┘
                           │                                           │
                           │◀──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           │
                     "Your balance is 1.5 BNB ($930.00)"
```

**Step by step:**

1. **You** type a question in natural language
2. **Claude** (the AI) interprets your question and picks the right agent and tool
3. **The MCP Server** translates Claude's request into a blockchain query
4. **The Blockchain** returns the real data
5. **Claude** formats the answer in plain English and responds to you

This all happens in about 1-2 seconds.

## Is It Safe?

| Concern | Answer |
|---------|--------|
| **Can it steal my crypto?** | No. Private keys are provided by you via local environment variables. The toolkit never stores, logs, or transmits them. |
| **Can the AI go rogue?** | Write operations (like sending tokens) ask for your explicit confirmation. Read operations (like checking balances) are safe and automatic. |
| **Is the code trustworthy?** | It's 100% open source. Anyone can inspect every line of code. |
| **Does it track me?** | No. Zero analytics, zero telemetry, zero data collection. |
| **What if I make a mistake?** | Start with "dry run" mode (preview only) and testnet (fake money). Only use mainnet when you're confident. |
| **Is it free?** | Yes. MIT license — free to use, modify, share. External services (CoinGecko Pro, Binance API) may have their own pricing. |

## What This Toolkit Does NOT Do

Being clear about limitations is just as important:

- **Not a trading bot** — It gives AI the *ability* to trade, but doesn't run autonomous strategies by default. You're in control.
- **Not financial advice** — Agents provide analysis, not recommendations. Always do your own research.
- **Not a wallet app** — It provides wallet *operations* (generate, sign, export), but it's not going to replace MetaMask or Trust Wallet as a daily driver.
- **Not magic** — The AI is only as good as the data and tools available to it. Market predictions are still uncertain.
