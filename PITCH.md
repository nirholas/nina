# Pitch

## One-liner

**BNB Chain AI Toolkit** gives AI assistants superpowers on the blockchain — 72+ agents, 6 MCP servers, and 900+ tools in one open-source repo.

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)

AI is transforming every industry — except Web3. Today, if you want an AI assistant to interact with BNB Chain, you need to:

- Build custom integrations from scratch
- Understand dozens of protocols individually
- Handle multi-chain complexity across 60+ networks
- Piece together fragmented, undocumented tooling

**Result:** Months of work before you can do anything useful.

---

## The Solution (60 seconds)

**BNB Chain AI Toolkit** is a single open-source repository that solves all of this:

**For AI developers:**
- Plug any of **6 MCP servers** into Claude, GPT, or any LLM — instant blockchain access
- **900+ pre-built tools** for trading, DeFi, market data, and wallet operations
- Works across **60+ chains** with a unified interface

**For BNB Chain users:**
- **72+ specialized AI agents** — ask questions in plain English, get expert DeFi answers
- Agents for every major protocol: PancakeSwap, Venus, staking, bridging, NFTs
- Available in **30+ languages**

**For the ecosystem:**
- **ERC-8004** — A new standard for on-chain agent discovery and trust
- **W3AG** — Web3 Accessibility Guidelines, making DeFi usable for everyone
- **Fully open source (MIT)** — anyone can build on it

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AI Agents | 72+ |
| MCP Servers | 6 |
| Tools | 900+ |
| Supported Chains | 60+ |
| Languages | 30+ |
| Original Standards | 2 (ERC-8004, W3AG) |
| License | MIT (fully open source) |

---

## Why Now?

1. **MCP is the new standard** — Anthropic's Model Context Protocol is becoming the universal way for AI to use tools. We built 6 production-ready servers for it.
2. **AI agents are going mainstream** — Every major company is building agents. BNB Chain needs the best tooling.
3. **Accessibility matters** — 1 billion+ people have disabilities. W3AG brings them into Web3.
