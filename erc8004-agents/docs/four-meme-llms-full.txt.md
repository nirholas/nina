Multi-Token Trading

With multi-token trading feature, when you create a token on Four.meme, you can now choose one of the supported tokens—$BNB, $USDT, $WHY, or $CAKE —as the trading pair in the internal liquidity pool. Once the pool reaches 100%, 20% of your tokens and all the collected supported tokens will be paired on PancakeSwap to establish liquidity.

1. Launch
2. Before launching, developers have the opportunity to purchase a portion of their token supply in the same transaction to protect your coins from snipers.
3. Lastly, confirm the transaction, and you're all set to go.

> *Note: Launching your project is free of charge on Four.meme, the only fee you will pay is the transaction fee which is \~0.005 BNB*

#### **Service fees**

Fair launching your project is virtually cost-free and immediately tradable, eliminating the need for seeding initial liquidity.

* Launching Fee

You'll only have to cover the transaction fee, which is around \~**0.005 BNB.**

* Trading Fee

While trading on our platform we take only 1% **fee**（minimum is 0.001 BNB）

* Seeding Fee

Once your project reaches 100% of the bonding curve (approximately 18 BNB), the seeding process will begin. We will establish a liquidity pool on Pancake paired with 18 BNB.

# Introducing Tax Tokens on Four.Meme

Tax Tokens are a token type on Four.Meme that allow builders to define on-chain transaction fees after launch, enabling sustainable incentives such as holder dividends, liquidity reinforcement, token

### 1. What is a Tax Token?

A Tax Token charges a predefined percentage fee whenever the token is traded **after** **graduation**.

These taxes are automatically handled by the protocol and can be allocated to one or more of the following destinations:

* Funds Recipient Wallet\
  Redirect tax proceeds to a designated wallet (e.g. treasury, operations)<br>
* Divide to Holders (Dividends)\
  Distribute rewards to holders who meet the minimum balance requirement<br>
* Burn (Reduce Supply)\
  Permanently remove tokens from circulation<br>
* Add to Liquidity\
  Automatically add liquidity to the trading pool

The total allocation must sum to 100%.

### 2. When Are Taxes Applied?

Taxes are applied only after the token is officially launched.

* ❌ No tax is charged during the bonding curve phase
* ✔️ Taxes activate once a token is graduated

This design protects users during the bonding curve phase and ensures a consistent, predictable trading experience for everyone once the token graduates.

### 3. Tax Rate Configuration

During token creation, builders can select a tax rate from predefined options:

* 1%
* 3%
* 5%
* 10%

The selected tax rate applies to each eligible trade after launch.

### 4. Dividend Distribution Mechanism

If a portion of tax is allocated to holder dividends, the system works as follows:

1. Taxes accumulate on-chain during trading
2. Once a predefined threshold is reached, accumulated tokens are converted into the base token (e.g. BNB or the trading pair asset)
3. Dividends are distributed proportionally to eligible holders<br>

Key principles:

* The more tokens a holder owns, the more dividends they receive
* Distribution is fully on-chain and transparent

### 5. Minimum Balance Requirement

Builders can define a minimum token balance required to qualify for dividends.

* Example: 10,000 tokens
* Wallets below this threshold will not receive dividends

This helps prevent dust wallets from consuming distribution resources.

### 6. Claiming Dividends

Holders can claim dividends in two ways:

* Automatic trigger:\
  Transfer any amount of tokens to trigger dividend distribution<br>
* Manual claim:\
  Claim directly from the token detail page<br>

Unclaimed dividends remain accumulated until claimed.

### 7. Anti-Sniping Protection

Free Mode includes an optional Anti-Sniping feature.

When enabled:

* High transaction fees are applied during the first few blocks after token creation
* Designed to reduce bot sniping and protect early liquidity

This feature is configurable at launch.

### 8. How to Create a Tax Token

To create a Tax Token on four.meme:

1. Select Free Mode (Tax Tokens are not supported in X Mode yet)
2. Enable the Tax option
3. Configure:
4. Tax rate
5. Allocation percentages
6. Minimum dividend balance
7. Recipient wallet address
8. Launch the token

All parameters are locked at creation and enforced by the protocol.

### 9. Summary

Tax Tokens on four.meme provide builders with:

* Flexible, transparent token economics
* Sustainable incentives for long-term holders
* Built-in liquidity and supply management
* Protection against early-stage bot abuse

Designed for builders who want to go beyond short-term hype.

# #6 Product Update 25-10-30

### 🚀 Product Update: X Mode

#### **Overview**

Fair Mode has been upgraded and rebranded as **X Mode**, launching at **8 AM UTC, Oct 30**.\
X Mode delivers a fairer and smarter token launch experience — now open to **all wallets** for smoother participation and improved transparency.

#### **⚙️ Key Upgrades**

**1️⃣ Dynamic Fee System**\
To ensure fair launches and counter bots, transaction fees automatically decrease block by block after token creation:

The parameters may be adjusted for future launches.

<figure><img src="https://1270958763-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FMKYhtLfncF7vyCOOt0Ef%2Fuploads%2FhL57XIz1h89QDkCMXyWw%2Fphoto_2025-10-29_17-05-55.jpg?alt=media&#x26;token=98123e30-03dd-46b5-b3e2-5c0b74d9d612" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**2️⃣ Automatic Buyback & Burn**\
After a token graduates from X Mode and its liquidity migrates to PancakeSwap:

* All launch fees above 1% are used to **immediately buy the token and burn it**, permanently removing it from circulation.
* For launches that don’t complete successfully, fees are redirected to a community address for later buy-and-burn or liquidity support.


# #5 Product Update 25-10-18

#### ⚙️ Token Name Protection

**Overview**\
Token Name Protection prevents duplicate or similar token names in Fair Mode, keeping launches clean, fair, and original.

\
**🔧 How It Works**

* When a token reaches 100+ holders during its bonding curve phase, its name and ticker are automatically locked for 72 hours.
* During this 72-hour period, no new Fair Mode tokens can be created with the same or similar name/ticker.
* The system checks both Fair Mode and Free Mode to prevent duplication across modes.
* Free Mode tokens are not restricted by this rule and can use any name.

**💬 Notes**

* If two tokens are created almost at the same time, both may succeed — this prevents bots from mass-locking names.
* Once protection is triggered, it continues even after the token officially launches.
* The 72-hour window and 100-holder threshold may be adjusted based on ecosystem feedback.

**💚 Purpose**\
**T**o ensure fairness, originality, and transparency — giving every meme project its own unique identity in the Four.Meme ecosystem.

# Accelerator Program

Hey Four.meme fam!

We at Four.meme are incredibly excited to announce the launch of the Four.meme Accelerator Program, a comprehensive initiative designed to empower memecoin projects on the BNB Chain.

#### What is the Accelerator Program?

Think of it as a comprehensive launchpad and growth initiative specifically tailored for memecoins. The Accelerator Program offers a multi-tiered support system, providing projects with support to thrive, from basic traffic support to in-depth ecosystem integration.

By achieving specific milestones, projects can unlock a range of incredible benefits, including increased platform exposure, marketing resources, including being featured in our weekly meme roundups, enhanced community building, and more!

#### Program Details:

Here's a sneak peek at what you can expect from the program:

* Basic Support: Gain access to on-platform traffic support and airdrop events to jumpstart your project.
* Platform Support: As your memecoin grows, unlock platform exposure through badges, social media promotion, and dedicated community support.
* Ecosystem Support: Reach new heights with BNB Chain integration, including recommendations and resource access.

We've also included a detailed table outlining the specific milestones and rewards associated with each tier. Check it out to see how your memecoin can benefit!

*The evaluation criteria for the accelerator program are designed to be flexible, meaning that market cap and trading volume thresholds will not be the sole factors considered for support.*

> \*Ecosystem support requires the BNB Chain team to complete due diligence on the project before it can be provided. Additionally, the conditions for LP support can be referenced as follows：<https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/bnb-chain-dedicates-900k-liquidity-pool-to-support-and-develop-meme-coin-ecosystem*>
